                For Restorative Bodyworks, I designed and built a website that captures the essence of 
                tranquility and healing that defines their massage therapy business. The website's theme 
                was chosen to mirror the soothing aesthetics of their studio, ensuring a seamless transition 
                from the digital space to the in-person experience.

                To enhance user experience, I created informative content that educates visitors about the 
                various services offered, emphasizing their benefits and contribution to restoring the body's 
                natural balance. The goal was to empower clients with knowledge.

                One of the website's standout features is the appointment booking functionality, designed 
                for user-friendliness. Clients can effortlessly choose their preferred date and time, making 
                scheduling a massage session a breeze.
